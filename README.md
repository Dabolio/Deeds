THIS MOD IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH BATTLE.NET OR THE VANILLA GAME AND I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE YOU CAUSE YOURSELF BY FAILING TO BACK YOUR OWN SHIT UP

I've been working on this project for a few years, on and off. The scope of what I've been able to do has been pretty limited due to things like technical knowledge and time constraints, but I'm pretty happy with the direction it's going in. I play sometimes with a group of old friends from highschool, and they've been calling it Deeds, so I suppose I'll go with that name.

Deeds represents a reclamation of Diablo II's roguelike roots. 

In general, combat has been slowed down to allow players sufficient time to react in PvM. Each swing of your weapon matters here. Good footwork and positioning are heavily encouraged for melee characters. Projectile weapons are no longer utterly spammable – you'll have to ration out your arrows, bolts, javelins, and knives carefully.

Monsters are tougher, hit harder, and stun you more. You're still a hero, but you're not a one-man army anymore. Gone are the soporific days of holding down left/right mouse button during combat.

Dungeons are dark. Light is precious.

Attrition is a real problem - potion drop rate has been lowered majorly such that they will mostly drop from champions/uniques now. Shrines won't regenerate unless you start a new session. Town healing has been removed completely.

Inventory and storage space has been increased significantly. Cubing recipes now exist for easily accessible respecs, rejuvenation potions, socketing items, etc.

Gambling and drop rates have been increased so you'll actually get to see some decent items in normal play instead of having gold be the joke it is in vanilla. They're still hard to find though.

Several skills have been revamped or changed significantly.

To give a few examples:
playing a sorceress no longer consists of casting projectiles and teleporting to the edge of your screen repeatedly, because that's boring and requires little skill.
Playing a paladin no longer consists of leaving an aura on right click and a combat skill on the left. (Basically everything eats mana now.)
"Trapsins" no longer beat out every other caster class. Trapping skills were redesigned to reward a more patient playstyle of premeditated murder. 

Some of the tooltips haven't been fixed yet. (I've been lazy or I've been busier with actually changing salient features of the gameplay, pick whichever sounds better to you.) There are features planned which haven't made it into the game yet, but it's still a work in progress.

Not every Diablo player will be able to survive in Deeds. Deeds is an experience that rewards you for actually playing well. That said, it's still designed for Hardcore to be clearable solo on /players 8 difficulty.
